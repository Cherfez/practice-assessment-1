This project had ups and downs. Some parts (routing for example) went well and I finished then easily, however other parts took me way too long.

I started setting up the files I thought I would need. I also added the different routes to link the pages. To check this I wrote some placeholder text in every file.
Once I noticed the files were connected correctly I applied the Navbar, because that would be one component that would come back in every file. I found the Navbar straight forward and finished it fairly quickly.

Next I read in the README.md the different steps I would need to complete.

The point I was struggeling with were the Callback props. I needed help from the teachers as I was doing too many steps on too many different places. I lost control and couldnt think about a solution anymore. Luckily it turned out that everytime I was close, so im getting there.

At this point I dont know what I would do different. I just need to practice more.
